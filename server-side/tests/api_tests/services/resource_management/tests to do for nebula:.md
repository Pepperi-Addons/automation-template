tests to do for nebula:
* table with underscore Done
* upload items, then hide schema, get schema/records requiring sync and then look for include_deleted Done
* if you turn sync to false, everything should be removed Done
* if you remove a schema, everything should be removed
* update a record and find it with getRecordsRequiringSync

**** JIRA - make record and schema node update simultaneously
